# Best Chat App (client)

BCA is a web application for exchanging messages and files.
The following technologies were used to implement this functionality:
- the client part is React.js in conjunction with TailwindCSS and the Zustand state manager;
- the server part is Express.js and the MongoDB database.

TypeScript and Socket.io web sockets were used to write both parts of the application.
